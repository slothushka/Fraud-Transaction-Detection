This Git repository contains a comprehensive fraud transaction detection system that leverages three powerful machine learning algorithms: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier, Logistic Regression, and XGBoost classifier. The implementation focuses on analyzing transactional data to identify and prevent fraudulent activities within financial systems.

Key Features:
- KNN Classifier: Utilizes the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm to detect anomalies and classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate based on the similarity to neighboring data points.
- Logistic Regression: Implements a linear classification algorithm for predicting the likelihood of fraudulent transactions using well-engineered features and interpretable results.
- XGBoost Classifier: Implements an ensemble learning algorithm with gradient boosting, capable of handling complex data patterns and providing feature importance scores for a better understanding of fraud indicators.
